Cogo Labs Leadership Principles

1. Take Big Swings

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders strive to spend their time exclusively on what's important, and they shed the rest. They seek out the highest return on their team's time and effort.

2. Data Driven

Leaders work backwards from the solution to generate plans. They use data to be sure their time and effort are always leveraged at the most impactful work. They admit when they are wrong and use the data to eliminate their blind spots.

3. Make Moonshine

Leaders create value from spare and under-utilized parts. They're resourceful and tenacious. They expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and they find ways to simplify. They are situationally aware; they look for good ideas from anywhere.

4. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders keep the standards relentlessly high. They demand high quality products, services, and processes because they deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders solve root problems and ensure that when problems get fixed, they stay fixed.

5. Bias for Action

Leaders run everywhere they go. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't need extensive study. Leaders value calculated risk taking because they know that in business, speed wins.

6. Have Integrity; Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is difficult or embarrassing. Leaders are not arrogant. They benchmark themselves against the best and identify their gaps.

7. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the bar with every hire and promotion. They want to work with other leaders. They recognize exceptional talent and enthusiastically propel them throughout the organization. Leaders are serious about their role in coaching others.

8. Ownership

Leaders think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They own all the inputs to their business. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

9. Disagree and Commit

Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or awkward. They have conviction; they do not compromise in the name of social niceties. Once a decision is reached, they commit wholly.

10. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at once with immense perspective and granular detail. No task is beneath them. They audit frequently, and they are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

11. Deliver Results

Leaders focus their time on the key drivers for their business. They pursue them obsessively to deliver results with the right quality and in a timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never compromise.","Senior Manager, Human Resources","Cambridge, MA",3.6,Unknown / Non-Applicable,"$80K-$140K

Our bioengineers make use of an in-house automated foundry for designing and building new organisms.

In recent months, we've been inspired and heartened by the tremendous public health response to COVID-19, and recognize that a similar scale of effort is needed by the biotech community to find long-term solutions to this crisis. In particular, testing is essential in order to resume our daily rhythms: communities need testing to reunite their people and culture. Businesses need testing to reopen their offices and provide confidence to their teams and stakeholders. And schools need testing to be able to reconvene their campuses and research communities. To respond to this acute and widespread need for COVID-19 testing, Ginkgo has developed a SARS-CoV-2 screening service - Concentric by Ginkgo - that is designed to provide broader access to COVID-19 diagnostic testing solutions. We’re building increased Foundry capacity to support high rates of testing frequency for our clients, offering an end-to-end, onsite testing service designed to test large communities of individuals. Performed at high-scale and high-throughput, this additional testing capacity will be essential for organizations, institutions, and companies to be able to reconvene their teams and reopen their communities.

Within the People Operations (PO) team, we propel Ginkgo's mission and efforts by helping to create the most effective team of GMO engineers the world has ever seen.

Drive the development, evaluation, and monitoring of our onboarding program, and participate in the hands-on management of weekly onboarding sessions to ensure success.
Understand the training and development needs of our Clinical Operations team in order to design and implement an interactive and effective training program for this organization.
Oversee the creation of a performance management program, including regularly scheduled performance reviews, for the Clinical Operations team, as well as supporting and training of supervisors to implement it.

Each of our project or country teams are supported through expertise and programming from additional offices around the world, combining world-leading expertise in core design areas with locally resident leadership and execution.

Our mission is to provide our pupils with a life-changing education and we believe that every child should have a right to world-class education regardless of her family’s income.

You’re also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, Bridge works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate – The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
A malleable learner – You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don’t rely your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.","Manager, People","Boston, MA",3.3,Unknown / Non-Applicable,"$20K-$43K

Description

This is a grant funded position and is not eligible for severance pay.

The Center for Science Education (CSE) at Tufts University School of Medicine, is creating new curricula and teacher training for National Institutes of Health (NIH) SEPA award. The Program Manager will acting as liaison between the CSE-based content specialists and co-design teacher collaborators. They will manage the daily activities of project, including curriculum design and evaluation. They will participate in the design of the new BioScann cases; The development of new in-person and remote professional development (PD) approaches; Recruitment of participants for the program; Production of research data that contributes to the knowledge base on career selection and persistence with respect to bioscience careers. They will also work closely with the PIs on all research efforts, and will report project findings in scholarly journals.

More details about the scope of the NIH SEPA project - The Great Diseases: Bridging biomedical career exploration, competency building and mentoring. In 2019 many bioscience and health related jobs are going unfilled, not only because too few STEM degrees are being granted (not all of these jobs require degrees) but also because adults either lack key competencies in thinking analytically and solving STEM-related problems or cannot apply them to STEM fields. Moreover, minority and under-resourced communities are disproportionately under-represented, in large part because they lack access to role models and information about what the careers entail. High school, where entire cohorts of the US population gather to learn together for the last time, is an obvious venue in which to develop these capacities and increase participation from all communities.

The CSE has a long-standing partnership with teachers in the majority/minority Boston Public Schools has developed a curriculum for 10th-12th graders that targets these competencies. Teachers who have been supported in learning to teach these novel concepts are able to significantly increase student engagement and analytical and problem-solving abilities from a large number of diverse schools and independent of the gender and ethnicity of the students, fostering their confidence in learning about health topics. However, this curriculum is not designed to integrate career awareness into competency building.

In this project we aim to capitalize on the partnerships, infrastructure and evaluation tools we have already deployed successfully to create a new curriculum and professional development model: It has three phases:

(1) We will create and implement new curricula that tightly integrate career awareness with competency building to improve student self-efficacy and outcomes expectations, critical first steps toward selecting a bioscience career. The curriculum will also provide extensive teacher professional development support.
(2) We will develop new online dual-enrollment courses in which students can gain college credits while still in high school. The courses will incorporate with skills and strategies needed for a successful transition to independent learning environments into cutting-edge biomedical science topics.
(3) We will provide students with financial support so they can participate in our intensive residential college awareness and readiness program and will optimize their success with near-peer mentor support before, during and after participation. Once the program has been created and evaluated, we will go on to disseminate the curricula and teacher support though our existing online infrastructure to reach maximal audiences.
